## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Parent invitation method: Unique link with embedded code that expires after acceptance
2. Negative balance handling: Prevented entirely; system blocks deductions exceeding current balance
3. Assumption updated: Non-negative balance constraint enforced

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (implementation planning)
